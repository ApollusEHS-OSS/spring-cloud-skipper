== Building
To build the source you will need to install JDK 1.8.

The build uses the Maven wrapper so you don't have to install a specific
version of Maven.  To enable the tests for Redis you should run the server
before bulding.  See below for more information on how to run Redis.

The main build command is

----
$ ./mvnw clean install
----

To create the executables and avoid running the tests and generating Javadocs, use the command

----
$./mvnw clean package -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true
----

NOTE: You can also install Maven (>=3.3.3) yourself and run the `mvn` command
in place of `./mvnw` in the examples below. If you do that you also
might need to add `-P spring` if your local Maven settings do not
contain repository declarations for spring pre-release artifacts.

NOTE: Be aware that you might need to increase the amount of memory
available to Maven by setting a `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable with
a value like `-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m`. We try to cover this in
the `.mvn` configuration, so if you find you have to do it to make a
build succeed, please raise a ticket to get the settings added to
source control.

=== Documentation

To generate just the REST Docs documentation, use the command

----
./mvnw test -pl spring-cloud-skipper-server-core -Dtest=*Documentation*
----

To build the asciidoctor documentation only, use the command

----
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests -Pfull -pl spring-cloud-skipper-docs
----

=== Importing into eclipse
You can generate eclipse project metadata using the following command:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw eclipse:eclipse
----

The generated eclipse projects can be imported by selecting `import existing projects`
from the `file` menu.
